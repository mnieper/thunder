* Garbage collector
** Implement ephemerons.
** Think of a keep are in the nursery for very young objects.

* Documentation
** Automatically create dist as CI artifact, and mention in README.
** Setup GitLab pages; create dist in pages.  Create manual in pages.

** Add pretty-printer to gdb for Scheme objects.  (See libguile for an example.)

* Instructions
** Allow to load dynamic libraries.
** Use allocai in trampoline to provide scratch "registers" to jitted code.

* Virtual machine
